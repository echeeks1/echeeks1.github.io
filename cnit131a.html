    <td>Homework 1</td>
    <td>My experience with Homework 1 was straightforward when I created the first list.  The suggested corrections were not that simple once I put it through the validation process.  Interpreting the W3C Validator and making the corrections resulted in the entire Homework 1 webpage going blank.  On the second day, I started over, completely deleting the code.  This time, I created a table instead of a list.  The validation process is the last step.</td>

    <td><a href="https://echeeks1.github.io/cnit131ahw2.html">Homework 2</a></td>
    <td>Homework 2 required many hours because the style and attributes needed more of my attention.  I am still trying to discover examples of two to three styles and attributes within the same line of codes.  I make progress and attribute it to the resources embedded within the homework assignment.</td>
